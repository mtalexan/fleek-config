#+TITLE: Writeable Emacs Configuration

*WARNING*: Tangle output files are always exclusively next to the fully-resolved path to the org file unless a different output
path is specified in the org file itself. While you can set a hardcoded output path as a =#+PROPERTY:=, you cannot set a dynamic
one this way, it will simply be ignored.
Instead we use a noweb refernece by defining a named src block here that has the code, then using it in each src block.
*Be sure each src block to be tangled uses =:tangle (expand-file-name "writeable.el" user-emacs-directory)= to specify the output path.*

* Introduction
This file is used to define a tangled configuration that is modifiable without needint to rebuild the nix home-manager config.

This file is loaded last, of all the emacs configuration files so it takes precedence.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle (expand-file-name "writeable.el" user-emacs-directory)
;; Placeholder so the generated el file isn't blank
#+end_src
