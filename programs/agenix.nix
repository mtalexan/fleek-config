  # WARNING: Only include one of homeage.nix and agenix.nix

  # The Home Manager module for agenix is undocumented, see https://github.com/ryantm/agenix/issues/50#issuecomment-1633579069

  # To use:
  # 1. Add an (r)agenix secret to the secrets/ folder (see secrets/secrets.nix for details).
  # 2. Add to hosts/*.nix a path to an out-of-band-transferred private SSH key that can decrypt the secret
  #    # Str or list of Strs for paths to the SSH private keys to use for decrypting the secrets
  #    age.identityPaths = [ "absolute path to secret key" ];
  # 3. Add the secret(s) to a *.nix module
  #    age.secrets."secretname" = {
  #      # path to encrypted file in git repo
  #      file = ./relative/path/to/file.age;
  #      # (optional) Str. Basename of the decrypted secrets file. By default it's the "secretname" part from the key.
  #      # name = "";
  #      # (optional) Str. Override for the pathed name the decrypted secret is located. By default it's the 'name' under the age.secretsDir folder.
  #      #path = "";
  #      # (optional)Str. Mode of decrypted file. Default is 0400.
  #      #mode = "";
  #      # (optional) Bool. Should the decrypted secret be linked to the location or copied? Default=true
  #      #symlink = true
  #    };
  # 4. Reference the decrypted file as part of a program config. E.g.
  #    vpn.wgConf = config.age.secrets."secretname".path;

  #  #           Alternatively, it may not be possible/allowed to symlink into a custom secretsDir location
  #  #           from the default secretsMountPoint.
  #  #           Any permissions issues with the mounting or symlinking produce no journald user entries, but will
  #  #           cause the a systemd user unit to error out when agenix.service tries to start.
